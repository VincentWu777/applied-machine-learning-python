# Applied Machine Learning with Python

This repository documents my systematic study of applied machine learning
using Python. The focus is on building correct end-to-end ML workflows,
including data handling, baselines, model selection, evaluation, and pipelines.

## Key Principles
- Always define the problem before modeling
- Prevent data leakage
- Use strong baselines
- Separate training, validation, and testing properly
- Prefer simple models unless complexity is justified

## Structure
- fundamentals/: Core ML concepts and workflow
- preprocessing/: Data cleaning and feature engineering
- models/: Supervised learning algorithms
- model_selection/: Cross-validation and tuning
- unsupervised/: Clustering and unsupervised methods
- projects/: End-to-end ML case studies
